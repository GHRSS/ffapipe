	abstract = {Searching for periodic non-accelerated signals in the presence of ideal white noise using the fully phase-coherent fast-folding algorithm ({FFA}) is theoretically established as a more sensitive search method than the fast Fourier transform ({FFT}) search with incoherent harmonic summing. In this paper, we present a comparison of the performance of an {FFA} search implementation using {RIPTIDE} and an {FFT} search implementation using {PRESTO}, over a range of signal parameters with white noise and with real telescope noise from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope ({GMRT}) High Resolution Southern Sky ({GHRSS}) survey with the upgraded {GMRT} ({uGMRT}). We find that the {FFA} search with appropriate de-reddening of the time series performs better than the {FFT} search with spectral whitening for long-period pulsars under real {GHRSS} noise conditions. We describe an {FFA}-search pipeline implemented for the {GHRSS} survey looking for pulsars over a period of 0.1–100 s and up to a dispersion measure of 500 pc cm−3. We processed {GHRSS} survey data covering ∼1500 deg2 of the sky with this pipeline. We re-detected 43 known pulsars with a better signal-to-noise ratio in the {FFA} search than in the {FFT} search. We also report the discovery of two new pulsars, including a long-period pulsar with a short duty cycle, using this {FFA}-search pipeline. A population of long-period pulsars with periods of several seconds or higher could help constrain the pulsar death line.},
