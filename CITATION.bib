    abstract = {Searching for periodic non-accelerated signals in the presence
                of ideal white noise using the fully phase-coherent Fast Folding
                Algorithm (FFA) is theoretically established as a more sensitive
                search method than the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) search with
                incoherent harmonic summing. In this paper, we present a
                comparison of the performance of an FFA search implementation
                using RIPTIDE and an FFT search implementation using PRESTO,
                over a range of signal parameters with white noise and with real
                telescope noise from the GHRSS survey with the uGMRT. We ﬁnd
                that FFA search with appropriate de-reddening of time series,
                performs better than FFT search with spectral whitening for long
                period pulsars in real GHRSS noise conditions. We describe an
                FFA search pipeline implemented for the GHRSS survey looking for
                pulsars over a period range of 0.1 s to 100 s and up to a
                dispersion measure of 500 pc cm−3. We processed GHRSS survey
                data covering ∼ 1500 degree2 of the sky with this pipeline. We
                re-detected 43 known pulsars with better signal-to-noise in the
                FFA search than in the FFT search. We also report the discovery
                of two new pulsars, including a long period pulsar having a
                short duty-cycle with this FFA search pipeline. The population
                of long period pulsars with periods of several seconds or higher
                can help to constrain the pulsar death-line.},
